# Manage contact
Contacts in the system can be generated through two main methods:

1. **Automatic Generation**: When visitors access the project's common URL
2. **Manual Creation**: Direct input by system administrators

## Administrative Controls

From the admin panel, administrators can:
- Configure new files in the knowledge base
- Share files and notes
- Send direct messages to contacts

These features enable efficient contact management and communication within the system.
