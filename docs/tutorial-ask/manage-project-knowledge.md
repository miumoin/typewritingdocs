# Knowledge base

Every project can maintain its own knowledge base to enhance response accuracy for user queries. This dedicated repository of information helps provide context-specific and relevant answers.

## Project Knowledge Options
Two primary methods exist for building your project's knowledge base:

1. **PDF Document Upload**
    - Upload technical documentation, specifications, or guides
    - System automatically extracts and indexes content
    - Supports searchable PDF formats

2. **Direct Text Notes**
    - Add quick notes or snippets directly
    - Write in text format
    - Instant indexing for immediate use

These settings ensure that responses align with your project's specific requirements and domain.
