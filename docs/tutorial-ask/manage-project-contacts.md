# Contacts

Each project in TypeWriting maintains a dedicated contact list with customizable knowledge bases. You can:

1. Share the project's default knowledge base
2. Create personalized knowledge bases for specific contacts

## Using Common Project URL

When users access the project through its common agent URL, they share the default project knowledge base. This ensures consistent information across team members.

## Creating Individual Contact URLs

Create separate URLs for each contact with customized knowledge bases:

1. Go to your project's contact management section
2. Click "Create New Contact"
3. Configure the contact-specific knowledge base
4. Share the generated URL

This approach lets you tailor information access for different team members while maintaining the core project knowledge base.
