# Signup and login

Typewriting offers two ways to get started:

- **Google Login**: Sign in quickly with your Google account
- **Email Login**: Register and login using your email address

Both methods provide secure access to all Typewriting features.


## Register using Email

To register using email:

1. Enter your email address
2. A verification code will be sent to your inbox
3. Enter the code to verify your email
4. You'll be automatically logged in

No password is required - the verification code ensures secure access to your account. This streamlined process makes it easy to sign up and sign in later using the same email verification method.

## Delete account

To request account deletion:

1. Send an email from your registered email account to typewriting-ai[at]gmail.com
2. Include "Account Deletion Request" in the subject line
3. We will process your request and confirm once completed

Note: Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
